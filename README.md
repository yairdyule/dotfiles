# Dotfiles

This is an attempt at making my dotfiles public.

They're highly experimental - i.e. not friendly to blind copypasta :laughing:

I'll attempt to list the important dependencies/plugins here in brief, and allow you to do the rest.

## Tools

The installation processes of these tools are usually pretty straightforward, so I've omitted any information about them as it would be redundant/inferior to what you'd find in their FAQs & forums :smile:

`Kitty`

`zsh`, and its plugins

- `exa`: pretty `ls`
- `lazygit`: incredible cli git interface
- `jump`: lazy, intelligent `cd` abbreviations
- `starship`: pretty, configurable command prompt
- `fzf`: awesome, fast list filtering
- `ripgrep`/`rg`: supa fast grepping, dependency of `fzf` & `nvim` plugins
- `bat`: `cat` file-viewer replacement, with syntax highlighting
- `zplug`: zsh plugin manager, used to install...
  - `zsh-autocomplete`
  - `fast-syntax-highlighting`
  - `zsh-autosuggestions`

### `nvim`


_note, my config was grokked from the amazing [Chris@Machine](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide) repo. check it out, as it provides a really wonderful intro!!_
